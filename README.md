# AlxEnum
Enumeration software written for my OSCP challenge. Based on some scripts I found online I decided to automate the enumeration phase. Provides an everything but the kitchen sink approach to scanning, any stealth is purely nice to have and may be added in the future.

I hope this may prove useful to anyone out there.
